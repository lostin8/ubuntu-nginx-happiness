======================

Step by step commands, config files and examples for setting up web server based on Ubuntu + NGINX + Varnish.
I've added some optimisations for speed and efficiency for small to medium size server (256mb to 2gb processor + 256mb to 3gb RAM).

This is cheat sheet I use for my own purposes every single time, when I'm setting up a web server from scratch. It is rather not exciting and time consuming task. I decided to make a small repo with all configs and steps necessary to set thigs up and running - without digging through various manuals, wikis, forums..
I use cloud based virtual servers but it 'should'* works for just any working web server based on Ubuntu.

*-Use your own brain and don't blindly copy and paste commands to your terminal.
