Ubuntu + NGINX settings for wordpress/ html5/ nodejs

Commands and config files examples for Ubuntu + NGINX + Varnish, and some other optimisation for speed and efficiency.

This is cheat sheet I use for my own purposes every single time, when I'm setting up web server from scratch. It is rather not exciting time consuming task. But due to my own 'memory leaks' problems I decided to make a small repo with all configs and steps necessary to set thigs up and running - without digging through various manuals, wikis, forums.. I use cloud based virtual servers but it 'should'* works for any working ubuntu web server.

*-Use your own brain and don't blindly copy and paste commands to your terminal.
