======================

Step by step: console commands, config files and real life examples for setting up the web server based on Ubuntu + NGINX + Varnish.
Additionally, I've added my optimisations for reasonable speed and efficiency for small to medium size server (256mb to 2gb processor + 256mb to 3gb RAM).

This is a cheat sheet I use every single time for my own purposes, when I'm setting up a production web server. As it is rather not exciting and time consuming task - I have decided to make a small repo with all those boring things as configs and steps - necessary to set thigs up and running.. without digging through various manuals, wikis, forums.

Usually I use cloud based virtual servers but it should* works just for any working web server based on Ubuntu.

*-Please use your own brain! And don't blindly copy and paste commands to your terminal - for your own safety.
